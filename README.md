## Description

A website that offers search engine optimization, social media marketing and online reputation management.
An important concept in web development is to make a website accessible for people with disabilities. Web accessiblity uses assitive technologies that create high-quality websites and web tools that will ultimately work for all people. In addition, another important concept is learning how to refactor code in websites to meet this criteria.

The goal for this project was to make a website more accessible in order to improve search engine optimization.

## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
